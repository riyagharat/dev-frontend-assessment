# DEV Assessment Assumptions

- Sorted asc/dsc with the company name instead of the ticker
- My main background is in Angular and Typescript over the past year
- Vue and Bulma are fairly similar to Angular and Bootstrap for me
- That being said, I had to overcome working with a new framework
- Assumed I was allowed to use Google and other resources to understand the framework
- I was not able to figure out a proper solution to the range option in time and thus completed an extra option instead.
