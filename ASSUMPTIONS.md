- My main background is in Angular and Typescript over the past year

- That being said, I had to overcome working with a new framework
- Assumed I was allowed to use Google and other resources to understand the framework

    - **Filtering** : Between a range of (at least) the following fields : 
        - "open"
        - "close"
