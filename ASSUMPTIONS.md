# DEV Assessment Assumptions

- Sorted asc/dsc with the company name instead of the ticker
- My main background is in Angular and Typescript over the past year
- Vue and Bulma are fairly similar to Angular and Bootstrap for me
- That being said, I had to overcome working with a new framework
- Assumed I was allowed to use Google and other resources to understand the framework

    - **Filtering** : Between a range of (at least) the following fields : 
        - "open"
        - "close" 


### Bonus Points
(These are not mandatory and if you choose to do any of these - please only choose one)

- Ability to click a single stock ticker and navigate to a dedicated page (has it's own route and URL) for viewing it
    - Find and use the API end point for selecting a single ticker so you can load all possible information for it
    - Display as much or as little information as you like about the ticker in question
